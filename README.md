The treasure hunt game is a simple maze game where the pirate is trying to reach the end goal of the treasure. The code that was given was code to create the maze, the pirate AI, and the exploration made by the pirate. The part that I completed was the Q-training algorithm. The deep Q-learning implementation allowed for the pirate to find the best possible navigation sequence that resulted in reaching the treasure. 

Throughout this course, I learned how computer scientists can create AI using data sets as well as the ethical concerns with AI. I also learned about the beneficial factors of AI and the different types of learning AI can do. This is important because there are so many improvements that can be made with AI in the field of computer science. Approaching problems as a computer scientist it is important to think about how the AI would work, the physical componenets needed, and the ethical concerns that can occur. The responsibilities to the end user and the organization is to limit and reduce biases that can occur and to maintain involvement in the AI leaning so it continues to meet the goals of the end user and the organization.
